# **Technical Report: Frequency Response Analyzer GUI**

## **1. Introduction**

The **Frequency Response Analyzer GUI** is a **LabVIEW-based** application that automates **signal generation**, **processing**, and **visualization**. It is specifically designed to enable **real-time signal analysis** through both **software simulation** and **hardware integration**. The tool targets engineers, researchers, and educators in **electronics**, **signal processing**, and **test instrumentation**, allowing them to **interactively test and visualize signal processing algorithms** with **real-time feedback**.

## **2. Project Overview**

### **2.1 Objective**
The primary goal of the **Frequency Response Analyzer GUI** is to enable **real-time frequency response analysis** of signals, both generated through software and processed through virtual filters. The system allows testing of signal processing algorithms in **real-time**, providing immediate visual feedback through **Bode plots**, **time-domain waveforms**, and **phase shifts**. It supports both **software-based testing** and integration with **external hardware** for signal generation and analysis.

### **2.2 Features and Functionalities**
This application integrates signal **generation**, **processing**, and **visualization** into a single user-friendly interface. Key features include:

- **Real-Time Signal Generation**: Users can define signal properties such as frequency, amplitude, and waveform type (e.g., sine wave).
- **Virtual Filtering**: The **virtual filter system** applies real-time signal processing, including **low-pass**, **high-pass**, **band-pass**, and **band-stop** filters, with immediate feedback.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Dynamic visualization of **Bode plots**, **time-domain waveforms**, and **phase shifts** provides users with immediate insight into signal changes.
- **Data Export**: The tool allows users to store signal data in **CSV format**, including all parameters and metadata (e.g., signal type, timestamp).

## **3. System Architecture**

### **3.1 Signal Generation and Processing**
The system interfaces with external hardware, such as signal generators and oscilloscopes, or can simulate signal generation entirely within **LabVIEW**. Real-time signal processing algorithms, including virtual filtering, are applied to the generated signals.

- **Virtual Signal Processing**: Includes **real-time application** of filters to generated signals, with immediate updates to the **visualizations** (Bode plots and time-domain waveforms).

### **3.2 Data Management**
The generated signal data is stored in **CSV format** at a user-defined location. The data includes:
- Signal parameters (frequency, amplitude, waveform type).
- **Metadata**, such as the timestamp of signal generation.
- **Error Handling**: The system provides real-time feedback on file path issues (e.g., invalid paths, insufficient permissions) and supports naming conventions for files.
