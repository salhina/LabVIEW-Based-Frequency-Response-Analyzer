# **Technical Report: Frequency Response Analyzer GUI**

## **1. Introduction**

The **Frequency Response Analyzer GUI** is a **LabVIEW-based** application designed to automate signal generation, processing, and visualization. It allows users to test signal processing algorithms using both real hardware and virtual filters, providing comprehensive analysis tools such as **Bode plots**, **time-domain waveforms**, and **phase shifts**. The application targets engineers, researchers, and educators in **electronics**, **signal processing**, and **test instrumentation**.

## **2. Project Overview**

### **2.1 Objective**
The primary goal of the **Frequency Response Analyzer GUI** is to enable real-time frequency response analysis of signals, both generated in software and processed through filters. The system allows for the testing of signal processing algorithms with or without external circuit interaction.

### **2.2 Features and Functionalities**
The application provides a user-friendly interface that integrates signal generation, processing, and analysis. The key features include:

- **Signal Generation**: Users can define signal properties such as frequency, amplitude, and waveform type (e.g., sine wave) via the GUI.
- **Virtual Filtering**: A **virtual filter** system enables users to test signal processing algorithms without needing external hardware, supporting **low-pass**, **high-pass**, **band-pass**, and **band-stop** filters.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: The GUI displays real-time **Bode plots**, **time-domain waveforms**, and **phase shifts**, allowing users to observe signal changes immediately.
- **CSV Data Storage**: The tool allows users to store signal data in **CSV format**, including relevant parameters and metadata.

## **3. System Architecture**

### **3.1 Signal Generation and Processing**
The system interfaces with external hardware (signal generators, oscilloscopes) or can simulate signal generation entirely within **LabVIEW**. The internal **virtual filters** are applied in real-time to simulate various signal processing effects, such as frequency filtering and phase shifts.  

- **Hardware Interface**: The system is compatible with **GPIB** and **USB** interfaces for integrating with external signal generation equipment.
- **Virtual Signal Processing**: Signal processing operations, including filtering and waveform analysis, are executed within LabVIEW, enabling real-time feedback and adjustments.

### **3.2 Data Management**
The signal data, including generated waveforms and processed results, is stored in **CSV format** at a user-defined path. The file includes:
- Signal parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude).
- **Metadata**, including the timestamp of signal generation.
- **Error Handling**: The system provides feedback on file path issues (e.g., invalid paths or access errors) and allows users to define a naming convention for each file (e.g., timestamp-based).

## **4. Functional Requirements**

### **4.1 CSV Data Storage and Path Feedback**
- **File Path Configuration**: Users select the storage path through a file dialog, with feedback provided if there is an issue with the selected path (e.g., insufficient permissions).
- **Data Format**: The signal data is stored in **CSV**, with each entry containing the signal's frequency, amplitude, and waveform type.
- **Error Handling**: Real-time notifications alert the user if there is an issue with file access.

### **4.2 Internal/Virtual Filter for Software Testing**
- **Real-Time Simulation**: The **virtual filter** allows users to test signal processing algorithms, applying them in real-time to the signal. Users can toggle between different filter types and see immediate updates on the signal waveform.
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Users can modify filter properties (e.g., cutoff frequency) using sliders or input fields in the GUI.
  
### **4.3 Detailed Signal Information Section**
- **Bode Plot**: The GUI displays a **Bode plot**, updating in real-time with magnitude and phase information for the signal across the frequency spectrum.
- **Time-Domain Waveform**: Displays the signal's time-domain characteristics, including **peak** values and **RMS**.
- **Phase Shifts**: Users can see how the signal's phase changes across different frequencies, providing valuable insights into signal processing effects.
- **Export Options**: The system allows users to export signal data and plots in **PDF**, **CSV**, or **PNG** formats for further analysis or documentation.
  
## **5. User Interface Design**

The user interface follows **LabVIEW's design principles** for consistency, clarity, and usability:
- **Signal Configuration**: Users configure signal parameters (frequency, amplitude, waveform type) through simple input fields and sliders.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: The system provides **visual feedback** (waveforms, plots) in real-time as users adjust signal parameters or enable filters.
- **Tooltips and Labels**: Each control and graph is clearly labeled, with tooltips available to guide the user.

### **5.1 User Interaction**
- **Signal Parameters**: Users adjust the signal's frequency and amplitude using **sliders** and input fields.
- **Virtual Filter Control**: A toggle switch enables or disables the **virtual filter**, with immediate updates to the signalâ€™s Bode plot and time-domain waveform.
